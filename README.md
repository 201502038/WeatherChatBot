# WeatherChatBot

All utterances must be in Korean.</br>
main1.py is the server of the chatbot which informs the weather.</br>
I implemented chatbot using <strong>Google Dial Flow<strong>.</br>
"(Location) Tell me the weather" will tell you the weather at that location.</br>
The program's demo source and example screen.</br>
